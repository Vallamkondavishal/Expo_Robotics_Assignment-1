## Introduction

This tutorial shows how to use the [topological_map.owl](topological_map.owl) ontology in ROS. 
Such an ontology  represents indoor locations and a mobile robot for surveillance purposes.

You can find such an ontology in this repository, where the [topological_map_abox.owl](topological_map_abox.owl) 
is a copy of the `topological_map.owl` file but with the Abox, i.e., with some 
individuals representing a specific environment for showing purposes. You might want to open 
the `topological_map_abox.owl` ontology with the Protégé editor (see installation below) to 
better know its structure, while the `topological_map.owl` ontology should be used by the 
robot within a ROS architecture.

You can see more about OWL ontologies through [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3Y8T6nIfXQ_UQOpCAr_HFSCwpTqELeP/view) 
popular tutorial.

## A Very Brief OWL-DL Premier

An OWL ontology is based on the Description Logic (DL) formalism, and it encompasses three sets 
made by entities:
 - the TBox encodes a tree of *classes*,
 - the RBox encodes a tree of *objects* or *data properties*, 
 - the ABox encodes a set of *individuals*. 
For simplicity, we will refer to a class with a capitalized name (e.g., `LOCATION`), to a data 
or object property with camel case notation (e.g., `isIn`), while individuals will have the first
letter capitalized (e.g., `Robot1`).
 
In particular, the individuals are related to each other through object properties, and 
with literals (e.g., integers, strings, etc.) through data properties. 

Individuals can be classified into some classes, which are hierarchically arranged in an 
implication tree, i.e., if an individual belongs to a class, such an individual would always 
belong to its super-classes as well. In other words, the child class always implies its parents.

Object and data properties have a domain and a range, and they can be specified in the definitions
of the classes for classifying individuals.

Note that the OWL formalism relies on the *Open Word Assumption*, which states that unknown 
information are neither verified nor false. Also, be aware that two entities (i.e., classes, individuals
or properties) might be equivalent to each other if not explicitly stated as *disjoint*.

Given some logic axioms in the ontology, a *reasoner* can be invoked to infer implicit knowledge.
We will also exploit SWRL rules, which are if-then statements. Since not all reasoners can 
process SWRL rules, we will use the *Pellet* reasoner. Also, since OWL reasoning is a 
time-consuming task, you should invoke it only when strictly required.

## Software Tools

Download the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/) editor for your operative system, and unzip it in 
your home folder. Open a terminal, go into the unzipped folder and open Protégé by entering `./
run.sh`. When Proégé starts, a plugin installation popup should appear (that popup can always 
be found at `File -> Check for Plugins`). From such a popup select `Pellet Reasoner Plugin` and 
`SWRL Tab Protege 5.0+ Plugin`. Then, install them and restart Protégé. When Protégé is running
again, go to `window -> tabs` and enable the `SWRLTab`. Now you can open an ontology available in this 
repository, update the  reasoner from the dedicated tab (on top of the window), and see the results.


To use an OWL ontology and the related reasoner within ROS, we will use the [aRMOR](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor). 
If necessary, follow the instructions to install it in your workspace, and also check its 
documentation for knowing how to use aRMOR. In addition, you might want to check the 
[armor_py_api](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor_py_api), which simplifies the calls to aRMOR,
but it can only be used from a python-based ROS node. 

## An Ontology for Topological Maps

<img src="https://github.com/buoncubi/topological_map/blob/main/figures/classes.png" width="300">

The ontology provided in this repository encodes the classes shown in the picture above, where 
each `LOCATION` can be a `ROOM`, if it has only one `DOOR`, and a `CORRIDOR`, if it has more 
doors. Each door is associated with a location through the object property `hasDoor`. In addition, 
each `LOCATION` has the data property `visitedAt`, which represents the more recent timestamp (in 
seconds) when the robot visited such a location (see figure below).

<img src="https://github.com/buoncubi/topological_map/blob/main/figures/location.png" width="300">

The `ROBOT` class contains only one individual (i.e., `Robot1`), which specifies some 
properties, as shown in the figure below. In particular, the `isIn` property specifies in which 
`LOCATION` the robot is, while the `now` property specifies the last timestamp (in seconds) when
the robot changed location. In addition, the property `urgencyThreshold` represents a parameter
to identify the `URGENT` location to be visited (see more details below).

<img src="https://github.com/buoncubi/topological_map/blob/main/figures/robot.png" width="300">

A new `LOCATION` can be defined by creating a new individual with some properties `hasDoor`, 
which are related to other individuals that might be created to represent doors. The `hasDoor` 
relations allows the reasoner to infer each individual of type `DOOR` and `LOCATION`, which can 
be of sub-type `ROOM` and `CORRIDOR`. For instance, the example implemented in the 
`topological_map_abox.owl` ontology tackles the environment described in the figure below.

<img src="https://github.com/buoncubi/topological_map/blob/main/figures/environment.png" width="300">

The ontology available in this repository also implements three SWRL rules to infer 
 - the locations that are connected to another location through a door,
 - the locations that the robot can reach by passing through a door,
 - the locations that the robot should visit urgently, i.e., it did not visit them for a number 
   of seconds greater than the value associated with the `urgencyThreshold` property.

After having invoked the reasoner, it infers several logic axioms, and the more interesting ones 
for this tutorial are:
 - properties `canReach`, which are generated to represent the locations that a robot can reach,
 - the type of each `LOCATION`, which can be a `ROOM` and, eventually, a `CORRIDOR`
   (note that a `CORRIDOR` is represented as a specific type of `ROOM`, i.e., an individual of 
   type `CORRIDOR` is always of type `ROOM` as well).
 - locations of type `URGENT`, i.e., the robot should visit them urgently.

Such a data representation should be used to represent that the robot visit a location. Then, 
the robot should stay there for a while before moving to another location, and such a motion
should be reflected in the ontology as well. In particular, the visiting policy should be such 
that the robot mainly moves across corridors but, when a near location becomes *urgent*, then 
it should go visit it.

Please check the `topological_map_abox.owl` file with Protégé to see how the concepts above are 
implemented in an OWL ontology. You can also start the Pellet reasoner to see its results 
(highlighted in yellow in Protégé) and change the individuals to appreciate the differences.

## Use the Ontology within a ROS-based Architecture

### The aRMOR service

We exploit the aRMOR server for using OWL ontologies in a ROS architecture. Use the following 
commands to create a ROS executable based on Java when aRMOR runs for the first time.

```bash
roscd armor
./gradlew deployApp
```

If you have a `roscore` running, you can launch the aRMOR server with 
```bash
rosrun armor execute it.emarolab.armor.ARMORMainService
```

Note, that if you want to run aRMOR from launch file you should use the following configuration.
```xml
<node pkg="armor" type="execute" name="armor_service" args="it.emarolab.armor.ARMORMainService"/>
```

aRMOR can perform three types of operations: manipulations, queries, and ontology management.
Ontology management involves several utilities, such as loading or saving an ontology, as well as
invoking the reasoner, etc. Manipulations are operations that change the logic axioms asserted in 
an ontology, e.g., adding an individual, replacing an object property, removing a class, etc. 
Finally, queries allow retrieving knowledge from the ontology, e.g., knowing the classes in which 
an individual belongs to, the properties applied to an individual, etc. 

By default, the entities (i.e., classes, individuals, properties) involved in  
manipulations are created if not already available in the ontology. Also, by default, queries 
involve the knowledge inferred by the reasoner, which should have been synchronized with recent 
manipulations, if any.

aRMOR shares the same message to perform each operation. Namely, each request involves the 
following fields.
 - `client_name`: It is an optional identifier used to synchronize different clients' requests. 
   In particular, when a client with a certain name requests an aRMOR operation, the request of 
   another client with the same name is refused with an error.
 - `reference_name`: It is the name of an ontology to work with.
 - `command`: It specifies the command to execute e.g., `ADD`, `LOAD`, `QUERY`, etc.
 - `primary_command_spec`: It is a specifier of the given `command` and it can be optional, 
    e.g. IND, FILE, etc.
 - `secondary_command_spec`: It is a further specifier of the given `command`, and it can be 
    optional.
 - `args`: It is a list of arguments used to perform the given `command` with the `primary` and 
   `secondary` `specifier`, e.g. the name of a class, a list of individuals, etc.

Please, check the [documentation](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor/blob/master/commands.md) to 
see the possible `command` and the relative `primary_command_spec`, `secondary_command_spec`, 
and `args`.

On the other hand, the response of aRMOR involves the following fields.
 - `success`: It is a Boolean specifying if the service was successfully computed.
 - `exit_code`: It is an integer specifying a possible source of errors.
 - `error_description`: It is a string describing a possible error.
 - `is_consistent`: It is a Boolean specifying if the ontology is consistent.
 - `timeout`: It is an optional field used while performing SPARQL queries.
 - `queried_objects`: It is an optional list of strings representing the queried entities.
 - `sparql_queried_objects`: It is an optional list of QueryItem (key-value pairs) given as the
   result of a SPARQL query.

Please, see the aRMOR [package](https://github.com/EmaroLab/armor) for more documentation.

For showing purposes, the following sections assume that aRMOR is running, and we will make requests
directly from the terminal, i.e., by using the `rosservice call ...` commands.

### Load an Ontology

Make the following request to load an ontology from file.
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'LOAD'
  primary_command_spec: 'FILE'
  secondary_command_spec: ''
  args: ['<path_to_file>/topological_map.owl', 'http://bnc/exp-rob-lab/2022-23', 'true', 'PELLET', 'false']"
```

Where we set a `client_name` which will be shared among all the clients since we do not need to
synchronize them. Also, we set a `reference_name` that will be used to always refer to the same
ontology loaded on memory.

Then, we configure the command with the following `args`.
 1. The path to the file containing the ontology to load.
 2. The IRI, which is specified in the ontology itself.
 3. A Boolean value set to `true` for specifying that the manipulation should be automatically applied. If 
    `false`, then the `APPLY` command should be explicitly stated to apply pending manipulations.
 4. The name of the reasoner to use.
 5. A Boolean set to `false` for specifying that the reasoning process should be explicitly stated. If
    `true`, then the reasoning process automatically runs after each manipulation; this would 
    lead to an expensive computation.

Note that, in this example, the 1st and 2nd fields of the request above do not change in the 
message below.

### Add a Location

An individual `L` that represents a new location can be added in the ontology if it is paired 
with one or more doors `D` through the object property `hasDoor`. This can be done with the 
following request made for each door of `L`.
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'ADD'
  primary_command_spec: 'OBJECTPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['hasDoor', 'L', 'D']"
```

When all locations (e.g., `L1....Ln`) and doors (e.g., `D1...Dm`) have been added, it is 
important to set them as different individuals, which can be done with the following request.
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'DISJOINT'
  primary_command_spec: 'IND'
  secondary_command_spec: ''
  args: ['L1', 'L2', ..., 'Ln', 'D1', 'D2', ..., 'Dm']" 
```

These logic axioms are enough to make the reasoning infer that `D` is a `DOOR`, and if `L` is
a `ROOM` or a `CORRIDOR`. In addition, these axioms allow the reasoner to infer the location 
that the robot can reach.

### Robot's Movements 

The `ROBOT` named `Robot1` is always in a location, and this should be consistently represented
in the ontology through the `isIn` property, over time. To represent the location of the
robot (e.g., `Robot1 isIn L1`), you should use the following request.
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'ADD'
  primary_command_spec: 'OBJECTPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['isIn', 'Robot1', 'L1']" 
```

Since the location of the robot should be unique, when the robot moves to another location 
(e.g., `L2`) we should remove the old `isIn` value. This can be done through the command
```
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'REPLACE'
  primary_command_spec: 'OBJECTPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['isIn', 'Robot1',  'L2', 'L1']" 
```

### Timestamps Updating

The instances representing the robot and locations are associated with a Unix timestamp, 
respectively through the `now` and `visitedAt` data properties, which are used to compute the 
urgency. 

Such timestamps might be represented in seconds, and they should be unique for each 
individual. Therefore, when a timestamp is introduced for the first time, the `ADD` command 
should be used. Then, similarly to above, the `REPLACE` command should be used for updating such 
a timestamp.

Note that the `REPLACE` command also requires the old value to override. Such a value might be 
retrieved from the ontology through a query. However, if some manipulations have been performed, 
or if it is the first query we request to aRMOR, then we should invoke the reasoner first, i.e., 
make the request
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'REASON'
  primary_command_spec: ''
  secondary_command_spec: ''
  args: ['']"
```

Then, we can query the timestamp associated with the robot, which represents the last time the 
robot changed location. Thus, use the following request, which should return `1665579740`.
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'QUERY'
  primary_command_spec: 'DATAPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['now', 'Robot1']" 
```

Now, we can finally update the timestamp associated with the robot (e.g., to `1665579750`) with:
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'REPLACE'
  primary_command_spec: 'DATAPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['now', 'Robot1', 'Long', '1665579750', '1665579740']" 
```

The above procedure concerns the logic axiom involving the `Robot1` individual, the `now` data 
property and a `Long` timestamp, and it should be done when the robot moves to a new 
location. When the robot enters a specific location, then the same procedure should also be used 
for such a location. For instance, let `Robot1` go in the location `L` at timestamp `1665579750`, 
then the `visitedAt` property of `L` should be replaced through the following request; where `
1665579710` is the last time `Robot1` was in `L` before.
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'REPLACE'
  primary_command_spec: 'DATAPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['visitedAt', 'L', 'Long', '1665579750', '1665579710']" 
```

### Retrieving Inferred Knowledge Through Queries

To retrieve inferred knowledge, update the reasoner with the `REASON` command above if some 
manipulation has been done from the last time the reasoner has been updated. Then, query all the 
`canReach` value associated with `Robot1` with
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'QUERY'
  primary_command_spec: 'OBJECTPROP'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['canReach', 'Robot1']" 
```
The request above would return a set of locations that the robot can reach by passing through a 
`DOOR`, e.g., `L1`, `L2`, etc.

Then, we can query information about these locations, e.g., 
```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'QUERY'
  primary_command_spec: 'CLASS'
  secondary_command_spec: 'IND'
  args: ['L1', 'false']" 
```
Which returns a set of classes that might involve `ROOM`, `CORRIDOR`, and `URGENT`.

### Save the Ontology

For debugging purposes, you can save the ontology manipulated so far in order to open it with
Protégé and inspect its contents. To save an ontology use

```bash
rosservice call /armor_interface_srv "armor_request:
  client_name: 'example'
  reference_name: 'ontoRef'
  command: 'SAVE'
  primary_command_spec: ''
  secondary_command_spec: ''
  args: ['<file_path>/my_topological_map.owl']" 
```
